PyBank was a financial analysis using profit/loss data over time provided. The analysis is presented in a final TXT document.

PyPoll was an election analysis to find the winner using ballot information provided. The analysis is presented in a final TXT document.

Code was developed using in-class examples, stack overflow to help with calculations, dictionaries, and code to help write the files to a txt document.
Tutoring from Matthew Werth also helped with debugging code and helping add things to my for loop.
AskBCS helped with debugging code and calculating change in profit/loss.
